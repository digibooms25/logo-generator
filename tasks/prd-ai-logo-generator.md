# Product Requirements Document: AI Logo Generator

## Introduction/Overview

The AI Logo Generator is an intelligent logo creation tool that will be integrated into the Wixel.com platform. This feature empowers users to create professional, customized logos through a combination of visual inspiration, AI generation, and natural language editing. The tool leverages Flux Kontext Pro AI image generation capabilities and an existing SVG icon service to produce high-quality, editable logos tailored to specific business needs.

**Problem Statement:** Creating professional logos is expensive, time-consuming, and often requires design expertise that many small business owners and content creators lack. Current logo generators produce generic templates that don't feel personalized or professional.

**Solution:** An AI-powered logo generator that combines visual inspiration with intelligent customization, allowing users to start with inspiration images and refine logos through natural language commands and precise SVG icon replacements.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Enable users to create professional, personalized logos in under 10 minutes
2. **User Experience Goal:** Provide an intuitive interface that requires no design experience
3. **Quality Goal:** Generate logos that are indistinguishable from professionally designed ones
4. **Business Goal:** Increase token consumption and premium conversions on Wixel.com platform
5. **Technical Goal:** Seamlessly integrate SVG icon service with Flux Kontext Pro for precise editing
